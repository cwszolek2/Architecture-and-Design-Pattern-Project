Double click project.exe.

**If this does not work (I have not extensively tested it), .jar file is provided.  To run, ensure java is in path, and type:
java -jar JarFile.jar
If recompilation is required (big sorry if this happens), all of source files are located in src folder.  Class files also located in class folder.
